# Controllable Discord Bot

<https://github.com/fourjr/discord-cli> but simpler.

This is a discord bot which you can control, it with a 'WYSIWYG' principle.

when you start the bot, load the token, then you are able to control it.

You can control the bot by editing the token at line 38, you need to copy a channel id and paste it as an integer for curr_channel.

After that, just start the bot, and it will handle the rest!
